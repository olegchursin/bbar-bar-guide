    <h2>Liqour / Distilled Spirits</h2>
    <p>A distilled beverage, spirit, liquor, hard liquor or hard alcohol is an alcoholic beverage produced by distillation of a mixture produced from alcoholic fermentation. This process purifies it and removes diluting components like water, for the purpose of increasing its proportion of alcohol content (commonly expressed as alcohol by volume, ABV). As distilled beverages contain more alcohol they are considered "harder" â€“ in North America, the term hard liquor is used to distinguish distilled beverages from undistilled ones, which are implicitly weaker.</p>
    <h3>The Distillation Process</h3>
    <p>The basic distillation procedure is the same regardless of the spirit. Alcohol is not "created" by distillation, just concentrated. A weak alcoholic beverage such as wine or beer is heated to boiling in a still (see illustrations below). Since the various constituents of the resulting vapor (like water, ethyl, methyl, and isopropyl alcohols) will vaporize and condense at different temperatures, they may be selectively extracted to create a new mixture which may then be further aged and/or flavored by the distiller. The different kinds of stills (e.g., pot still, column still) function in different ways and result in products of vastly different makeup and taste, but the basic process is the same: slowly boil the liquid and keep the vapors you want.</p>
