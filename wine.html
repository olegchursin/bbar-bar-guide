    <h2>WINE</h2>
    <p>Wine is an alcoholic beverage made with the fermented juice of grapes. Technically, wine can be made with any fruit (i.e. apples, cranberries, plums, etc) but most wines are made with wine grapes.</p>
    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>Archaeological evidence has established the earliest known production of wine from fermented grapes during the late Neolithic site of Hajji Firuz in the northern Zagros Mountains or early Chalcolithic in the northern edge of the Middle East. The earliest chemically attested grape wine was discovered at Hajji Firuz in the northwestern Zagros Mountains, ca. 5400 BC. Both archaeological and genetic evidence suggest that the earliest production of wine may slightly predate this, with the earliest wine-making likely having taken place in Trans-Caucasia (including Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia), through the region between Eastern Turkey, and Northwest Iran.</p>
    <p>The earliest form of grape-based fermented drink was found in northern China, where archaeologists discovered 9000-year-old pottery jars, while the earliest archaeological evidence of wine particles found has been in Georgia, where archaeologists discovered evidence of wine residue inside ceramic jars that were dated back some 8000 years and Iran (c. 5000 BC). The earliest evidence of wine production was discovered in Armenia within the Areni-1 winery in 2007 and is at least 6100 years old, making it the oldest winery in the world. The development of a winery implies wine had started being produced much earlier.</p>

    <h3>What are Wine Grapes?</h3>
    <p>Wine grapes are different than table grapes: they are smaller, sweeter and have lots of seeds. Most wines are made with a single species of grape that originated in Caucasus  called Vitis vinifera. There are thousands of different varieties within the Vitis vinifera species–the most common is Cabernet Sauvignon.</p>

    <h3>The Origin of the term “Vintage”</h3>
    <p>Wine grapes take an entire season to ripen and thus, wine is produced just once a year. This is where the term vintage comes from: “Vint” stands for “Winemaking” and “age” implies the year it was made. So, when you see a vintage year listed on the label, that’s the year the grapes were picked and made into wine. The harvest season in the northern hemisphere (Europe, US) is from August–September and the harvest season in the southern hemisphere (Argentina, Australia) is from February–April.</p>

    <h3>Non-Vintage (NV) Wine</h3>
    <p>Occasionally, you’ll find a wine without a vintage listed on the label. Typically, this is a blend of several vintages together; and in the case of Champagne, it will be labeled with “NV” which stands for “Non-Vintage.”</p>

    <h3>Classification</h3>
    <div class="liqour">
      <h4>Single-Varietal Wine</h4>
      <p>A single-varietal wine is made primarily with one type of grape. It’s common to see these wines labeled by the name of that grape variety. For example, a bottle of Riesling is made with Riesling grapes. It’s useful to note that each country has different rules for how much of the variety should be included in order to be labeled as a varietal wine.</p>
      <p>Percentage Required to Label as a Single-Varietal Wine</br>
      <ul>
        <li>75% USA*, Chile, South Africa, Australia, Greece</li>
        <li>80% Argentina</li>
        <li>85% Italy, France, Germany, Austria, Portugal, Spain, New Zealand</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="note">*Oregon requires 90% of the varietal</div>
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="liqour">
      <h4>Wine Blend</h4>
      <p>A wine blend is a wine made with a blend of several grape varieties. Blending is a traditional method of winemaking, and today there are several famous wine blends produced in classic winemaking regions. Just so you know, most wine blends are mixed together after the fermentation (and aging) is complete. When grapes are blended and fermented together it is called a field blend. A famous example of a field blend is Port wine.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>BBAR'S SELECTION</h3>
    <p><strong>What is ABV?</strong></br>ABV = Alcohol by volume (abbreviated as ABV, abv, or alc/vol) is a standard measure of how much alcohol (ethanol) is contained in a given volume of an alcoholic beverage (expressed as a volume percent). It is defined as the number of millilitres of pure ethanol present in 100 millilitres of solution at 20°C.</p>

      <h4>Pine Ridge Chenin Blanc Viognier 2014</h4>
      <p><img src="img/wine-chenin.jpg" alt="Chenin Blanc" class="brand-img-h-150"></p>
      <p><strong>History:</strong> In the early 1990s, Pine Ridge crafted this unusual and delectable blend as an experimental bottling, creating one of our most beloved and popular wines. This unique marriage of two varietals that would never share the same bottle in their native France unites the crisp, honeyed fruit of Chenin Blanc with the plush body and juicy stone fruit notes of Viognier, for a wine that is both sophisticated and easy to enjoy.</p>
      <p><strong>Tasting notes:</strong> The newest release of our intriguing blend delights the nose with a charming bouquet of enticing aromas of fresh Meyer lemon, fuzzy peach, ripe honeydew melon and yellow plum, mingled with touches of citrus blossom and white tea. The clean, vibrant palate enters with juicy pomelo, sweet lychee and honeyed tangerine fruits, balanced by vibrant acidity and hints of yellow apple and key lime pie that last through the crisp and refreshing finish.</p>

Reflecting both the relatively cool climate of our Oak Knoll District of Napa Valley estate vineyard and the Trefethen family’s preference for balanced wines, this classic style dovetails perfectly with the growing movement of connoisseurs in the United States away from wines of unbridled alcohol and ripeness toward wines of greater finesse and food-friendliness.</p>
      <p><strong>Tasting notes:</strong> Flavors of citrus, peach & nectarine make this wine great for sipping. Bright fruit leads to notes of graham cracker & baking spices while enhancing the full-bodied mouthfeel. - Winery</p>

      <h4>Red</h4>
      <p>Red wine is a type of wine made from dark-coloured (black) grape varieties. The actual colour of the wine can range from intense violet, typical of young wines, through to brick red for mature wines and brown for older red wines. The juice from most purple grapes is greenish-white; the red colour comes from anthocyan pigments (also called anthocyanins) present in the skin of the grape; exceptions are the relatively uncommon teinturier varieties, which produce a red colored juice. Much of the red-wine production process therefore involves extraction of colour and flavour components from the grape skin.</p>

            With the explosive growth that California's wine industry has seen the past several years, it's easy to view winemaking and grape growing in the Golden State as a recent phenomenon. And while it's true that California's viticultural history is brief compared to several European countries, this state's roots date back well over 200 years. Due to the enormous response to California wine within the United States and worldwide, there are thousands of excellent and diverse wines being produced within the state each year.</p>
            <p><strong>Apppellation: Central Valley/Lodi</strong></br>With a reputation for bulk wine and table grapes, little to no quality wine has emerged from the expansive Central Valley since companies like Franzia and Gallo staked their claim here. The exception are new wine ventures in sub-AVAs Lodi and Clarksburg, home to jammy zinfandels and surprisingly distinguished chenin blancs respectively.</p>
